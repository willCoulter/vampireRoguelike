#Playtesting

The game was play tested by multiple users of multiple backgrounds:

- Users found overlooked bugs like no save folder being found because of different folder layouts between computers(this has been fixed)
- Users found that from a visual standpoint the tile assets used where boring or too static after a while.

Colin and I spent time validating values for the player stats as well as testing these effects on the saving and loading of data.

Try your best to defeat all 5 bosses!
