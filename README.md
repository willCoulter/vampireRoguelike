# Project Startup Guide - The Crimson Crypt
## WC Entertainment - Will Coulter and Colin Landry

### What is the Crimson Crypt 
-The Crimson Crypt is a top down rogue-like genre game for pc, mac and linux systems. The game was created in the unity engine as part of our capstone assignment. But now let's really talk about the game.

- The Crimson crpyt is all about two things defeating enemies and getting better at it. The player is a vampire with a sword that will explore the dungeon and defeat it's bosses. Along the way you'll discover various blood powers that let you use a varity of ablites in exchange for the blood you gain from defeated enemies. 

- You'll also discover chests that reweard you with more passive upgrades like more damage and health.

### Playtesting

The game was play tested by multiple users of multiple backgrounds:

- Users found overlooked bugs like no save folder being found because of different folder layouts between computers(this has been fixed)
- Users found that from a visual standpoint the tile assets used where boring or too static after a while.

Colin and I spent time validating values for the player stats as well as testing these effects on the saving and loading of data.

Go from room to room to defeat enemies to gain blood and gold. Blood can be used to cast skills, which can be bought on each floor from the skills vendor with gold. Once you feel strong enough, head to the boss room and take on the challenge that awaits on each floor. The bosses will get progressively harder as will the levels. Try your best to defeat all 5 bosses!
